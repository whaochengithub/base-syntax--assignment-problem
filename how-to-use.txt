How to use the downloaded files

1) Run "npm install" in the extracted folder
2) Run "npm start" to view the project

Compare my code to yours to solve issues you might encounter. You may also copy the content of src/ into your own project's src/ folder to use your project setup (which might've been created with a different create-react-app version) and still use my code.

npm install --save d3 
npm install --save react-bootstrap bootstrap
